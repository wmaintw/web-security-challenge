      <h4>What is Cross-Site Scripting</h4>

      <p>
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into
        otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send
        malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these
        attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the
        output it generates without validating or encoding it.
      </p>

      <h4>Impact</h4>

      <p>
        An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to
        know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from
        a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information
        retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
